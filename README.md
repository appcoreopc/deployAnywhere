# deployAnywhere


Deploy anywhere is a tool that allows user to defined what is required and it will take care of the work of provisioning infrastructure and code. 

Problem statement 

It is so common that organization goes from azure devops build agent to on prem build agent. They even change their architecture based on different stages of application lifecycle. 

For example, they want to deploy to Azure during development, so their security team can perform pen test. 
Or in case development team started developing their application in the cloud but due to cost, need to move to on-prem. 
This takes alot of effort and money. You need to setup your infrastrucutre and then change your deployment pipelne. 

This tool aim to make this deployment easy
